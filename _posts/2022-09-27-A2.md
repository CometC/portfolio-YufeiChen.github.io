# 1. My Collections

![Untitled](Assignment%202%20Twitter%20Diverge%20cb214fffb5e54481916f7b30fdd0f3f8/Untitled.png)

### Problem:

When a user has bookmarked so many tweets in different topics, the bookmark page will be flooded with too many information and it is bothering to find the content wanted.

### Type: Concept Adoption

### Concept Outline:

When adding a bookmark via the sharing button, user will be informed which collection list it will be added in, and user can get the tweet from subdivision of bookmark bar; in both interface user will be able to add new classifications and rename the older ones.

# 2. Most Featured

### Problem:

When user is trying to find some really useful information (like instructions, long text, paper abstract etc.), they might not be liked by so many people but will be bookmarked more. New sorting measurement should be taken more than the ‘top’ and ‘latest’.

### Type: Concept Invention

### Concept Outline:

This part has the same UI level as ‘top’ and ‘latest’ under the topic hastag, in which tweets are ranked by bookmark counts rather than other statistics.

# 3. Find Related

### Problem:

Users are not getting their interested tweets efficiently especially when in tweets does not contain hashtags or user are new to the topic and do not know how to precisely follow. A more closely guided function should be implemented to calibrate the recommendation.

### Type: Concept Invention

### Concept Outline:

When user locate at the exact tweet they interested in, they can choose to find more related tweets, which contains similar tweets measured by algorithms.(may be similarity to image, text, user related etc.)

# 4. Preview

### Problem:

Twitter’s image upload functions is not satisfying. Some images will be cropped randomly and influence the visibility of some important information in it, especially when multiple images are added or the ratio of image do not fit in the web/mobile app page size.

### Type: Concept Adjustment

### Concept Outline:

A preview function is added to see the automatic layout of the tweet. If not satisfied, user can make some adjustment to the tweet then formally tweet it.

# 5. User Summary

### Problem:

Twitter does not have a well-formed documentation page of the user. It takes time to scroll down and often get lost when the tweets are in huge quantities.

### Type: Concept Adoption

### Concept Outline:

Taking reference to some personal blog’s representation, the tweets will be compiled by montly timeline and both users/viewers can see their records more easily. For users it provides more visual methods to organize their contents, and the viewers can get condensed information to decide whether to follow or not.

# 6. Go Raid!

### Problem:

Getting tired of recommendation and being trapped in similar contents everydauy? Try something completely unfamiliar. Random fun things might happen

### Type: ConceptInvention

### Concept Outline:

In the search page user can slide to this catagory. In the content it will provide user some random topics.
